# Jarvis-voice-assistant-using-Python
Jarvis Voice Assistant üéôÔ∏è A Python-based voice assistant inspired by Jarvis from Iron Man, designed to respond to voice commands and perform tasks such as searching Wikipedia, opening websites, conducting Google searches, and more! This assistant provides spoken feedback for seamless, hands-free interaction.

#Features
Voice Recognition: Listens to voice commands and transcribes them into actionable queries.
Text-to-Speech: Provides spoken responses to make interaction more engaging.
Wikipedia Integration: Searches Wikipedia and returns a brief summary of the user-defined query.
Web Browser Control: Opens popular websites like Google, Instagram, and Spotify based on voice commands.
Google Search: Conducts a Google search and returns the top results.

#Requirements
Python 3.x
Required libraries:
pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech)
speech_recognition (Voice Recognition)
wikipedia-api (Wikipedia integration)
googlesearch-python (Google search)

#How It Works
Start the assistant and follow the prompts.
Speak commands such as:
"Wikipedia Elon Musk"
"Open Google"
"Google Python programming"
Jarvis will recognize the command, respond, and perform the action.
Future Improvements
Enhanced NLP: To improve command recognition and understanding.
Custom Commands: Allow users to add custom commands.
Voice Feedback Toggle: Option to switch between voice and text-only responses.
